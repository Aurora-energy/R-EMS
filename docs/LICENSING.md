# Licensing Overview

R-EMS assets are made available for evaluation, development, and integration testing during the pre-alpha phase.

- Development and test usage is permitted without a commercial agreement.
- Production deployments require a signed licence negotiated with Ocean Batteries.
- Premium security modules (PKI, secure enclaves, hardware attestation) are delivered as optional licensed features.
- Integrators must ensure their deployments remain compliant with regional grid and marine authority regulations.

For licence discussions contact the maintainers through the Ocean Batteries commercial team.

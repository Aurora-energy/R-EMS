# Test Harness Orchestrator

The test harness subsystem coordinates scenario execution, captures telemetry,
and evaluates pass/fail criteria across the distributed EMS deployment. This
bootstrap document highlights the foundational tasks required before advanced
scenario automation is introduced.

> Version management across simulation components adheres to the guidelines in
> [`/docs/VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md).

## Responsibilities

- Define crate boundaries for harness orchestration logic.
- Provide a location for YAML-based scenario definitions.
- Align logging and reporting expectations with the broader R-EMS platform.

## Roadmap

Future milestones will introduce scenario parsers, execution orchestration, and
reporting pipelines. Companion documents will cover each capability as it is
implemented.

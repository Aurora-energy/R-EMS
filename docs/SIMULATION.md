# Simulation & Telemetry Subsystem

The simulation subsystem provides deterministic and reproducible telemetry
streams for validating the R-EMS orchestration pipeline. This bootstrap
milestone documents the scope and expectations for upcoming simulation
features.

> Release versioning and compatibility guarantees follow the guidance in
> [`/docs/VERSIONING.md`](./VERSIONING.md).

## Objectives

- Establish the `r-ems-sim` crate as the home for simulation engines.
- Provide a standalone `r-ems-simgen` CLI for generating fixtures.
- Lay the groundwork for replay tooling and validation harnesses.

## Next Steps

Subsequent implementation steps will extend the engine with telemetry models,
replay capabilities, and automated testing flows. Detailed design notes will be
captured in dedicated documents alongside the corresponding modules.

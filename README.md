# R-EMS ‚Äî Rust-based Energy Management System

‚ö†Ô∏è **Status: This project is NOT in release yet ‚Äî it is pre-alpha, not stable.**  
Development is ongoing. Interfaces, APIs, structure and features will change.

---

## üìñ Project Purpose
R-EMS is an **energy management system written in Rust**.  
It is designed for high-reliability, redundant multi-grid environments, including:  
- Land-based battery installations.  
- Marine systems with parallel grids and controllers.  
- Simulation/testing with replay and synthetic data.  

The architecture emphasizes **resilience, security, observability, and modularity**, with clear boundaries between core, messaging, persistence, orchestration, networking, and simulation.

This project exists to break down the barriers created by proprietary EMS systems, which often make troubleshooting in the field nearly impossible and slow down the transition to sustainable energy solutions. Just as Linux democratized and revolutionized the internet by providing a solid, open foundation, this initiative aims to deliver a similar breakthrough for energy management creating a transparent, reliable, and community-driven platform that helps and accelerates adoption and innovation in the global shift to renewable power.

- Useful for testing integrations without real hardware.
    

---

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI & Setup Wizard

- Access via web browser after starting R-EMS.
    
- Guides you through first-time installation:
    
    - Define installation name.
        
    - Configure grids and controllers.
        
    - Enable simulation or production mode.
        
    - Save validated configuration.
        

---

## üì¶ Installer

Install via helper script:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

Supports Docker, systemd, and bare-metal deployments.

---

## üîí Security & Licensing
